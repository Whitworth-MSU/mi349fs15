After spending a couple days - a week on the old comp, I lacked the ability to make it look appealing and functional so I scrapped it for a much simpliar comp. I kept the featured tab becuase I really wanted that to be the major part of my old comp, but I made it much simpilar with only 2 tabs. The old comp caused for many different floats and absolute postions that was causing issues with readability and just looked unappealing. My new comp is very square which I think adds a little but of consistency troughout the site.
