Taken straight from my about page:

My website is not a real website this is for MI349 for MSU. There are only 4 pages which can be accessed using the navigation on the left. The first is the index which is accessed by click in "GameFolio" box. The 2nd is in the About Tab which should've brought you to this page where I am explaining this. The 3rd is under Games->Browse Games. Lastly the fourth is under Users->Browse Users. Other pages have text that looks like links but are not, this was for style reasons and to give the apperance of a finished site. The entire nav bar is not functional because I do not have pages for those and linking to an empty site would have been awful.
